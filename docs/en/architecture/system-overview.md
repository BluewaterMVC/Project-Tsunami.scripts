# ðŸŒŠ Bluewater Scripts System Overview

This document presents a high-level architectural summary of the **Bluewater Scripts** repositoryâ€”defining its mission, scope, principles, integration points, and how it powers automation across the Bluewater platform.  
It serves as the authoritative entry point for all contributors, maintainers, and integrators working with project automation.

---

## 1. Purpose & Vision

The **Bluewater Scripts** repository is the **single authoritative source for all automation and developer workflow tooling** within the Bluewater ecosystem.

- **Mission:** Deliver seamless onboarding, continuous integration, documentation automation, and internationalization for all Bluewater repositories (framework, docs, and more).
- **Vision:** Provide maintainable, cross-platform, and fully documented automation to accelerate development, enforce quality, and foster global collaboration.

---

## 2. Scope

**Bluewater Scripts** is responsible for:

- Developer onboarding and multi-platform setup
- Automated documentation generation, translation sync, and status tracking
- Git hooks for commit, push, merge, and onboarding
- Linting, formatting, and standards enforcement (code & docs)
- Distributing and synchronizing common automation scripts to downstream repositories
- Internationalization (i18n) management and structure validation

**Out of scope:**  
- Core business logic, framework/application source code, or end-user scripts (these belong to other Bluewater repositories)

---

## 3. Integration Points

- **Downstream Repositories:**  
  Scripts are propagated via submodule or onboarding automation to:
    - `bluewater-framework`
    - `bluewater-docs`
- **Continuous Integration (CI):**  
  Every script is cross-platform tested on commit/pull, and any failure blocks merge.
- **Documentation Automation:**  
  All doc repositories depend on these scripts for metadata automation, translation sync, status badges, and structure enforcement.

---

## 4. Architectural Principles

- **Single Source of Truth:**  
  All automation scripts are developed, reviewed, and versioned in this repository. Downstream modifications are forbidden and overwritten on sync.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**  
  All scripts must function on Windows, Linux, and macOS (unless explicitly noted).
- **Automated & Documented:**  
  Every script must be self-documenting and follow [project technical documentation standards](../technical/git-scripts-usage.md).
- **Security & Transparency:**  
  All changes require review, are tracked via semantic versioning, and must comply with [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [SECURITY.md](../../../SECURITY.md).

---

## 5. Roadmap & Extensibility

- Scripts are designed to be **modular**, configurable, and extensible for future needs.
- New automation or integration requirements should be proposed via PR with supporting architectural documentation.
- See [roadmap-extensibility.md](./roadmap-extensibility.md) for planned enhancements and priorities.
