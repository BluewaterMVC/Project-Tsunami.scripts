# 🛠️ Bluewater Scripts: Roadmap & Extensibility

This document defines the **strategic roadmap, extensibility guidelines, and deprecation policies** for Bluewater Scripts automation.  
It describes current milestones, future features, and the standards/processes by which new scripts, integrations, and upgrades are evaluated and adopted.

---

## 1. 🌊 Vision & Principles

- **Automation-First:**  
  Prioritize automation and reliability at every point in the contributor workflow.
- **Modular & Maintainable:**  
  All scripts and tooling must be self-contained, versioned, and easy to extend or replace.
- **Polyrepo & Multilingual:**  
  Designed for distributed, multi-repository projects and robust internationalization.
- **Security & Auditability:**  
  All changes, syncs, and upgrades are tracked, versioned, and reviewed.
- **Open Participation:**  
  The roadmap and feature set are community-driven and evolve with real-world needs.

## 3. 🔮 Extensibility Standards

### a. **Pluggable Scripts & Extensions**
- All automation is modular; new scripts should live under `/scripts/plugins/` or a similar extensible location.
- Extension points are declared in a manifest/config file.
- All scripts must include version headers and follow documentation/metadata standards.

### b. **Configuration & Overrides**
- Support per-repo and per-team settings using versioned YAML/JSON config files.
- All configuration changes must be documented and peer-reviewed.

### c. **API & Integration**
- Core logic should be exposed via CLI and Python APIs, supporting consumption by other tools or CI.
- External projects may contribute, override, or extend the automation pipeline as long as standards are met.

### d. **Cross-Platform & CI**
- Scripts must be portable (Linux, macOS, Windows) and verified by CI on every commit/PR.
- Contributors are encouraged to write tests and automation for all supported platforms.

---

## 4. 📈 Deprecation & Upgrade Policy

- **Deprecation Notices:**  
  Mark any obsolete script as `Deprecated` in both metadata and documentation. Maintain backward compatibility for at least one minor release.
- **Changelog Tracking:**  
  All script changes must be logged in `/CHANGELOG.md` with a clear summary, version, and rationale.
- **Semantic Versioning:**  
  Scripts must use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) in headers, filenames, and changelogs.
- **Breaking Changes:**  
  Breaking changes require prior discussion in a GitHub Issue and a minimum 2-week review window.
- **Community Feedback:**  
  Major deprecations or upgrades are reviewed during roadmap meetings and community calls.

---

## 5. 🧩 Proposal & Review Process

- **How to Propose New Scripts or Features:**
  1. Open a GitHub Issue labeled `feature` or `proposal` with a detailed summary, rationale, and, if relevant, example code or config.
  2. Optionally, create a discussion thread for early feedback.
  3. All proposals require a review from at least one core maintainer and must reference relevant architecture docs.
- **Adoption & Onboarding:**
  - Accepted proposals are prioritized in the roadmap, linked to a milestone, and tracked through to release.
  - Contributors may be asked to co-author docs or tests for their features.
- **Community Involvement:**
  - All users are encouraged to upvote, comment, and provide use cases to influence roadmap prioritization.
