# üìë Bluewater Scripts: File Header & Metadata Policy

This document defines the **standards, required fields, placement, and automation policies** for the file header metadata block that appears at the top of all documentation files in the Bluewater Scripts repository.
It ensures consistent, up-to-date, and machine-readable metadata for every document in all languages.

---

## 1. Purpose & Goals

* **Single Source of Metadata:**
  Establish a uniform, automated metadata block for every doc to support traceability, status tracking, versioning, and automation.
* **Automation-First:**
  Eliminate manual drift and error by assigning header management to scripts, not contributors.
* **Machine & Human Readability:**
  Ensure both automated tooling and project contributors can quickly find document status, scope, and authorship.

---

## 2. Header Block Fields & Format

Every documentation file must begin with the following metadata block, directly below the language navigation bar (if present), and **delimited by unique HTML comment markers**:

```markdown
<!-- FILE HEADER:START -->
üìÑ **File:** /path/to/file.md  
üîÑ **Status:** IN PROGRESS  
üïí **Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD  
üîñ **Version:** 1.0  
üì¶ **Scope:** üåê Public ‚Äì All Contributors  
üë®‚Äçüíª **Author:** Bluewater Team
<!-- FILE HEADER:END -->
````

**Field Definitions:**

* **File:** Full repo path, always relative from repo root
* **Status:** Current workflow status (see [Documentation Status Policy](./documentation-status-policy.md)); e.g. NOT STARTED, IN PROGRESS, IN REVIEW, PUBLISHED, NEEDS UPDATE, DEPRECATED
* **Updated:** Last modification date (auto-set by automation)
* **Version:** Semantic version or doc version (auto or config)
* **Scope:** Audience and visibility, e.g., Public, Internal, Translation Team
* **Author:** Primary authors/maintainers (can be default or configured)

**Do not hand-edit the metadata block.**
The block is always wrapped with `<!-- FILE HEADER:START -->` and `<!-- FILE HEADER:END -->` for safe and reliable automation.

---

## 3. Placement & Template Use

* **Always appears as the very first Markdown block** (after the language banner)
* **NEVER manually edited by contributors**
* Contributors place a `{{file_header_block}}` placeholder in new files; automation replaces this placeholder with the fully rendered header block (including the comment markers).
* If missing, automation will insert the block and notify the contributor.
* When a file is edited and already contains a header block (between the markers), automation will update or replace the block as needed.

---

## 4. Status Field Workflow

* **Statuses include:**

  * NOT STARTED (empty or placeholder files)
  * IN PROGRESS (actively authored, but not ready for review)
  * IN REVIEW (under peer/maintainer review)
  * PUBLISHED (approved and current)
  * NEEDS UPDATE (detected out of date by automation or flagged by contributors)
  * DEPRECATED (marked for deprecation, not deleted)
* **Transitions** are managed by automation based on workflow events (see [Documentation Status Policy](./documentation-status-policy.md)).
* Status can be updated automatically in pre-commit, CI, or PR/merge automation.

---

## 5. Versioning & Change Tracking

* **Version:** Updated when content changes, major updates, or structural changes occur.
* Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for major doc sets; patch version can auto-increment with script logic.
* **Updated:** Field is always set to the last commit date that modified the file.

---

## 6. Extensibility & Custom Fields

* New fields may be proposed and added via architectural review.
* All scripts must tolerate unrecognized fields (for forward compatibility).
* Custom fields (e.g., reviewer, language team, review deadline) can be added as project needs grow, but must be documented here and in technical docs.

---

## 7. Automation Policy

* **Automation is authoritative:**

  * Only scripts update or create the metadata block.
  * Manual edits to the header are discouraged and may be overwritten.
  * The automation script detects either the `{{file_header_block}}` placeholder or an existing header block (between the comment markers), and inserts or updates as needed.
* **Pre-commit hook or CI job**:

  * Scans files for the placeholder or comment markers.
  * Inserts or updates the block according to policy.
  * Updates status, date, and any other required metadata.
* All automation must reference this document and [file-header-automation.md](../../technical/file-header-automation.md).

---

## 8. Manual Overrides & Exceptions

* In rare cases (emergencies, custom workflow), maintainers may override automation with a documented reason.
* Such changes must be reviewed and reverted to automated control as soon as feasible.
