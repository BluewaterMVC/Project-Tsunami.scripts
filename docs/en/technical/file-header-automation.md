# üè∑Ô∏è File Header Automation

This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing and maintaining the **automated metadata header block** (`{{file_header_block}}`) in Bluewater Scripts documentation.  
It describes how the system ensures every file is consistently labeled, up-to-date, and compliant with project metadata standards.

---

## 1. Purpose

Automating the file header block guarantees all documentation includes standardized metadata such as file path, status, version, and authorship. This supports searchability, auditability, translation tracking, and transparency across the project.

---

## 2. Scope

This process applies to **all Markdown documentation files** (root, architecture, technical, i18n, etc.) in the Bluewater Scripts repository and is enforced for all language trees.

---

## 3. What is the File Header Block?

The **file header block** is an automated section at the top of each document, **delimited by unique HTML comment markers** for safe automation:

````markdown
<!-- FILE HEADER:START -->
üìÑ **File:** /docs/en/technical/file-header-automation.md
üü¢ **Status:** ‚úÖ Approved
üïí **Updated:** 2025-07-01
üîñ **Version:** 1.0
üì¶ **Scope:** üåê Public ‚Äì All Contributors
üë®‚Äçüíª **Author:** Bluewater Team
<!-- FILE HEADER:END -->
`````

**Do not hand-edit this block.**
All changes are made by the automation process on commit, push, or PR.
The block is always bounded by `<!-- FILE HEADER:START -->` and `<!-- FILE HEADER:END -->`, allowing the automation script to find and update the metadata reliably.

---

## 4. Automation Process Overview

### a. **Trigger Points**

* On every commit, push, or pull request, the pre-commit hook or CI job:

  * Scans files for either the `{{file_header_block}}` placeholder or an existing header block (between markers).
  * If the placeholder is found, it is replaced with the rendered metadata block (including the markers).
  * If an existing block is found (delimited by the markers), it is updated in place.
  * If neither is found, the header block is inserted at the top of the file (after any language navigation bar).

### b. **How Values are Determined**

| Field   | Source/Logic                                                                                             |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| File    | Calculated from repo path; always absolute from project root                                             |
| Status  | Determined by automation: Not Started, In Progress, In Review, Ready for Production, In Production, etc. |
| Updated | Set to last commit affecting the file                                                                    |
| Version | Default is `1.0`; can be overridden in config or tags                                                    |
| Scope   | Default or set per repo/config (e.g., "Public ‚Äì All Contributors")                                       |
| Author  | Default is "Bluewater Team"; can be set in config or contributor list                                    |

### c. **Automation Responsibilities**

* Insert, update, or replace the header block as needed.
* Prevent manual drift‚Äîwarn if hand edits are detected.
* Support root and language-specific files.
* Log all automated changes (for CI traceability).

---

## 5. Setup & Configuration

### a. **Pre-commit Hook / CI Workflow**

* Use the provided Python (or shell) script located at `/tools/file-header-update.py`.
* Add to the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` or your project‚Äôs CI workflow (see `/.github/workflows/`).
* Configuration file:

  * Defaults can be set in `/tools/config/header-config.yml`.

### b. **Manual Overrides**

* Rarely needed.
* If required, document in a YAML frontmatter block above the header (automation will preserve these).

---

## 6. Error Handling & Troubleshooting

* **Missing `{{file_header_block}}` and no header block:** Script inserts the block at the top after any language banner.
* **Header Drift/Manual Edit:** Script overwrites and logs a warning if changes within the block are detected.
* **Config Errors:** CI fails with error message and link to documentation.
* **Unsupported File Types:** Skipped with notice.

---

## 7. Handling Translations

* The header block is rendered per file, per language.
* The `Status:` field reflects translation status if under `/docs/{lang}/`.
* Automation updates all corresponding translated files upon source changes (see [Translation Status Policy](../architecture/i18n/translation-status-policy.md)).

---

## 8. Example Automation Script Usage

```shell
python3 tools/file-header-update.py --all
```

*Scans all docs, updates/inserts header blocks as needed.*

Add to pre-commit in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
-   repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: file-header-update
        name: Update File Header Block
        entry: python3 tools/file-header-update.py
        language: python
        files: \.md$
```
